    <h1>Hello World from AI</h1>
    <p>A small demo page created by an AI assistant. Below is a curated list of widely referenced AI models and the areas where each one is particularly strong. This is not exhaustive but covers major model families across language, vision, speech, and specialized scientific models.</p>

    <h2>AI models and their strong points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="model">GPT-4 (OpenAI)</span>: Excellent at natural language understanding and generation, multi-turn dialogue, complex reasoning, code generation, and instruction-following.</li>

      <li><span class="model">GPT-3.5 (OpenAI)</span>: Efficient conversational agent: fast, cost-effective for many chat and generation tasks; good for prototyping and lightweight applications.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Claude (Anthropic)</span>: Focuses on helpfulness and safety; strong at following detailed instructions while minimizing harmful or risky outputs.</li>

      <li><span class="model">LLaMA / LLaMA 2 (Meta)</span>: Open research-oriented large language models optimized for efficient fine-tuning and deployment; popular for local inference and customizable pipelines.</li>

      <li><span class="model">BERT (Google)</span>: Bidirectional encoder that excels at sentence-level understanding tasks like classification, named entity recognition, and sentence-pair tasks.</li>

      <li><span class="model">RoBERTa (Facebook)</span>: An improved BERT-style model with more robust pretraining; typically achieves better performance on many NLP benchmarks.</li>

      <li><span class="model">T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)</span>: Reformulates diverse NLP tasks into a text-to-text format; strong for translation, summarization, and unified multi-task learning.</li>

      <li><span class="model">PaLM (Google)</span>: Large multilingual model with strong few-shot reasoning and knowledge recall; used for advanced reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks.</li>

      <li><span class="model">BLOOM</span>: An open, multilingual generative model designed for research and transparent use; good for cross-lingual generation and experimentation.</li>

      <li><span class="model">OPT (Meta)</span>: Research-focused open pretrained transformer providing a reproducible baseline for large model experiments.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Vision Transformer (ViT)</span>: Applies transformer architectures to images; strong for image classification and transfer learning in vision tasks.</li>

      <li><span class="model">CLIP (OpenAI)</span>: Learns joint image-text embeddings, enabling powerful zero-shot image classification and robust image–text matching.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Stable Diffusion</span>: Open-source text-to-image diffusion model; great for flexible, high-quality image generation and artistic workflows.</li>

      <li><span class="model">DALL·E (OpenAI)</span>: Text-to-image generation with strong compositionality and creative visual outputs.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Midjourney</span>: Highly stylized image generation with an emphasis on artistic, visually rich results favored by creatives.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Whisper (OpenAI)</span>: Robust, open speech-to-text model covering many languages; excels at transcription and diarization tasks in noisy environments.</li>

      <li><span class="model">Segment Anything Model (SAM)</span>: A foundation model for image segmentation; excels at zero-shot interactive segmentation and rapid annotation workflows.</li>

      <li><span class="model">AlphaFold (DeepMind)</span>: State-of-the-art protein structure prediction; transformative for computational biology and predicting 3D protein structures from sequences.</li>

      <li><span class="model">AlphaZero / AlphaGo</span>: Reinforcement-learning agents that excel at planning and strategic gameplay; pioneering advances in self-play and search-guided learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <footer>Note: This list highlights major model families and their commonly cited strengths. New models and variants are released frequently; consider this a snapshot rather than an exhaustive catalog.</footer>
