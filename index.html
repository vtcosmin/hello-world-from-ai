    <h1>Hello World from AI</h1>
    <p>
      A small demo page created by an AI assistant. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study and engineering of systems that can perform tasks
      that typically require human intelligence — such as recognizing patterns, understanding and generating language, making decisions, and
      learning from data.

      Today AI powers many practical applications, including search and recommendation systems, language translation, virtual assistants,
      and image generation. If you're getting started, consider learning the basics of machine learning, experimenting with pre-trained models,
      and trying beginner-friendly libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
